# Data 145: Evidence and Uncertainty
{: .mb-2 }
UC Berkeley, Spring 2026
{: .mb-2 .fs-6}

Welcome to Data 145! When we learn about the world from data, how much can we rely on the conclusions we draw? How do we know if we could do better?

<!-- This course covers the statistical theory required to measure and control our uncertainty when we analyze large and complex modern data sets. We will use mathematical and computational lenses to examine optimality properties and error bounds. The class will be fast-paced and math-intensive. Students will be expected to learn independently and participate actively in all lecture and discussion sessions.

## Prerequisites

- Math 53 (Multivariable Calculus)
- Data C100 (Principles and Techniques of Data Science)
- Data C140 or EECS 126 (C- or better, or Pass grade)

## What You'll Learn

This course covers statistical theory for measuring uncertainty in large datasets:

- **Paradigms of Inference**: Bayesian and frequentist approaches to statistical reasoning
- **Asymptotic Methods**: Large-sample theory and approximations
- **Finite-Sample Methods**: Exact inference for small samples
- **Parametric and Nonparametric Techniques**: Model-based and distribution-free methods
- **Causality**: Causal inference from observational and experimental data
- **Multiple Testing**: Controlling error rates when testing many hypotheses -->
