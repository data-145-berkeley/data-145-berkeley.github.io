# Course Policies

This page outlines the policies and expectations for Data 145. Please read this
carefully and refer back as needed throughout the semester.

## Grading

Your grade will be determined by the following components:

| Component | Weight |
|:----------:|:-------:|
| Weekly Assignments | 25% |
| Midterm Exam | 30% |
| Final Exam | 45% |
{: .tight-table}

### Exams

Mid-semester and final assessments will include:

- Problem-solving
- True/false conceptual questions
- Statements of major results along with their assumptions

In addition, the final exam will include an essay demonstrating a thorough
understanding of one topic from a short list (not provided ahead of time) of
primary topics from the course.

### Letter Grades

There is no "curve" or pre-determined distribution of letter grades. Summaries
of class performance will be provided after the midterm. Shortly before RRR
week there will be another performance summary as well as some letter grade
guarantees such as, "An overall score of at least x% will earn at least an A-."

## Attendance and Work Submission

- **Attendance**: Lecture and discussion attendance is strongly recommended but
  not required. Attendance will not be recorded.
gradescope_course_id: 1206670
- **Submission**: Weekly assignments will be submitted on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/{{ site.gradescope_course_id }}) every Monday at 5pm.
- **Late work**: No late submissions will be accepted except for students who
  have DSP extended time accommodations or other justifications mandated as
  acceptable by the campus. Solutions will be released 24 hours after assignments are due.
- **Dropped scores**: The two lowest assignment scores will be dropped in the
  calculation of the overall assignment grade.

## Collaboration and Integrity

You are encouraged to discuss practice problems and homework with your fellow
students and with course staff. Arguing with friends about exercises is an
excellent and time-honored way to learn. However, **you must write up all your
own assignments and code by yourself**.

Copying assignments from other sources is not only dishonest, it also doesn't
help anyone. Each exercise requires its own combination of ideas, and each
student needs practice in coming up with those combinations, or else they will
be at a loss when trying to use probability theory in their future work.

From a purely practical perspective, **all students must work independently on
Data 145 assessments---no collaboration allowed**. If an assessment is the
first time a student works independently, then the assessment is not likely to
go well.

### Course Materials

Data 145 materials are the intellectual property of the course developers.
From the campus statement on [Academic Integrity](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/academic-integrity):
"... students may not circulate or post materials (handouts, syllabi---any
class materials) from their classes without the written permission of the
instructor."

### Consequences

We are tough with dishonest students and we hope that we will not be put in
that situation in this class. We expect that you will work with integrity and
with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will
work with integrity and with respect for you.

## Community Standards

Ed is a formal, academic space. We must demonstrate appropriate respect,
consideration, and compassion for others. Please be friendly and thoughtful;
our community draws from a wide spectrum of valuable experiences.

For further reading, please reference
[Berkeley's Principles of Community](https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community)
and the [Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct](https://conduct.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct/).

## Data Science Student Climate

[Data Science Undergraduate Studies](https://data.berkeley.edu) faculty and
staff are committed to creating a community where every person feels
[respected, included, and supported](https://data.berkeley.edu/about/diversity-equity-inclusion).
We recognize that incidents may happen, sometimes unintentionally, that run
counter to this goal. There are many things we can do to try to improve the
climate for students, but we need to understand where the challenges lie.

If you experience a remark, or disrespectful treatment, or if you feel you are
being ignored, excluded or marginalized in a course or program-related
activity, please speak up. Consider talking to your instructor, but you are
also welcome to contact Executive Director Christina Teller at
cpteller@berkeley.edu or report an incident anonymously through the
[online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBwaUe7VMQz6VzkYFvf4KYwNSTve9iJlBSQyAmsXoSE0LnWw/viewform).

## Accommodations

We honor and respect the different learning needs of our students, and are
committed to ensuring you have the resources you need to succeed in our class.
If you need religious or disability-related accommodations, if you have
emergency medical information you wish to share with us, or if you need special
arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please share this
information with us as soon as possible.

- **Disabled Students Program**: If you have physical, psychological, or
  learning disabilities that could affect your performance in the course, we
  urge you to contact [DSP](https://dsp.berkeley.edu).
- **Religious Observance**: If you require accommodation for religious
  observance, please contact us at least a week before the deadline in question
  to make arrangements.

## Regrades

- **Deadline**: Regrade requests must be submitted within **one week** of
  receiving your score
- **How**: Submit a regrade request on Gradescope with a clear explanation
- **Note**: We may regrade the entire assignment, which could result in a
  lower score

## Communication

- **[Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/90354/discussion/)**: Use for all course-related questions. We aim to respond
  within 24 hours
- **Email course staff at [data145@berkeley.edu](mailto:data145@berkeley.edu)**: Use only for private matters (grades, personal circumstances)
- **Office hours**: The best place to get help with assignments and concepts
